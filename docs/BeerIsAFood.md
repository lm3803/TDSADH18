BEER IS A FOOD

FOR the good of the public health, it is highly desirable that all predjudice against beer should be removed. This prejudice is held exclusively by people who do not drink beer -- AND IT IS FOR THEM ESPECIALLY THAT THIS ADVERTISEMENT HAS BEEN PREPARED.

Beer is the mainstay of practical temperance and provides a mild and wholesome beverage.
It contains an immense amount of nourishment in a delightfully refreshing form. 
It is not only most palatable, but is a wonderful aid to digestion. 
It is a type of food which is very rapidly absorbed into the circulation and requires no preliminary digestion, but is easily oxidized in the tissues, thus affording a valuable source of energy. 

The greatest Physicians and Scientists the world over advocate the moderate use of beer. 
Prof. Chas. Fred'k Chandler, Chemistry Expert of Columbia University, on Octber 5th, 1914, said...
"Beer is one of the few foods that is free from bacteria. BEER and BREAD are both made from. Bread contains water and is solid. Beer contains water and is liquid. Yeast makes both more palatable and digestable. And only when taken in large quantities is beer intoxicating. 
Dr. Henry Davy, Pres. British Medical Society, London, Eng:...
"Beer, bread, and cheese for a meal is infinitely more scientific than the American meal of bread, tea, and jam."

Prof. Aldolph Struempel, Vienna, Austria:...
"Because his brain was starving his body from ? I prescribed beer and bread for Mr. E. H. Harrbman, to give him added energy, build tissue and give more strength. "
